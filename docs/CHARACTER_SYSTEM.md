# Character Creation & Privacy System

## Overview

The bot now features a comprehensive character creation system with privacy protection and command locking. Users must create a character profile before accessing any bot commands (except `/jack-in` and `/privacy`).

## User Journey

### 1. Privacy Consent (`/jack-in`)
- **First-time users** see a detailed privacy notice explaining data collection and storage
- Users can view more details or accept/decline consent
- **Declining** prevents bot usage but allows restart anytime
- **Accepting** creates a user record and proceeds to character creation

### 2. Character Creation
- **Street Name**: Custom character name (2-32 characters)
- **Backstory**: Optional character background story (up to 1000 characters)
- **Background Selection**: Choose from 6 character backgrounds with unique bonuses

### 3. Background Types

| Background | Starting Credits | Bonuses | Description |
|------------|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| **üèôÔ∏è Street Kid** | 300 | +5 Street Cred, +2 Combat | Born on the mean streets |
| **üèúÔ∏è Nomad** | 400 | +5 Tech, +2 Combat | Badlands survivor with mechanical skills |
| **üè¢ Corporate** | 800 | +3 Netrunning, +2 Street Cred, +2 Cybernetics | Ex-corpo with inside knowledge |
| **üíª Netrunner** | 500 | +7 Netrunning | Master of cyberspace |
| **üîß Techie** | 600 | +6 Tech, +1 Cybernetics | Machine and gadget expert |
| **‚öîÔ∏è Solo** | 450 | +6 Combat, +1 Cybernetics | Professional mercenary |

## Command Locking System

### Restricted Commands
All commands except `/jack-in` and `/privacy` require character creation:
- `/profile`, `/daily`, `/hack`, `/heal`, `/upgrade`, `/credits`, `/leaderboard`, `/admin`

### Access Control
- **Before character creation**: Users get a prompt to use `/jack-in`
- **After character creation**: Full access to all bot features
- **Privacy commands**: Always accessible for data management

## Privacy Features

### Data Transparency (`/privacy view`)
Shows all stored user data including:
- Character information (street name, background, backstory)
- Game progression (level, XP, credits, stats)
- Activity timestamps
- Privacy consent date

### Data Portability (`/privacy export`)
- Exports user data in JSON format
- Excludes sensitive internal identifiers
- Handles large exports gracefully

### Right to Deletion (`/privacy delete`)
- **Complete data removal** from all database tables
- **Immediate effect** - requires new `/jack-in` to use bot again
- **Logged action** for audit purposes

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- New character fields
street_name TEXT,
background TEXT,
backstory TEXT,
privacy_accepted DATETIME,
character_created BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
```

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection

## User Benefits
